Since traditional sports has had a lot of data driven approaches applied to it (Moneyball), we thought that a data driven approach could be applied to ESports since a lot of data is recorded in realtime and is made available online.\n",

What might have been a major factor at one time period of LoL could be replaced by another factor in the future, or could have past changes we did not fully account for. If our hypothesis is wrong, we will have to find different data sources to support that our hypothesis is wrong by giving a new one. If our methods are wrong, we have to research more mathematical and logical functions in Python, to compare the data articulately. Regardless, we believe that we will alter our hypothesis to include more details, from the data and analysis that we will be performing."
